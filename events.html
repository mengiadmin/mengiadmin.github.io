                Unfiled is the two-headed beast of Atli Bollason and Guðmundur Úlfarsson. They began working together in 2019 with a series of experimental A/V nights in Mengi. Their practice still revolves around certain key concepts established in those early days: feedback systems, the mechanics of signification, visual improvisation, memories, ghosts, noise. For Unfiled, music and visuals are not simply complimentary but inseparable.</br></br>

                Their self-titled debut album (released in May 2025) was made in the post-industrial city of Łódź, Poland and drew comparisons with Emptyset, Ben Frost and Franck Vigroux. It is spacious and eerie yet often overpowered by deafening noise and chugging, metallic rhythms that evoke steam-powered looms and spinning machines.</br></br>

                For their upcoming show in November, they’re eager to try out some brand new in-progress material for the first time. </br></br>

                Saturday, November 29th</br>
                JÚLÍA MOGENSEN feat.</br>
                ÞÓRANNA DÖGG BJÖRNSDÓTTIR</br>
                JAN HENDRICKSE</br>
                doors 19:30 / show 20:00</br>
                2500kr / 2000kr</br></br>

                In collaboration with Þóranna Dögg Björnsdóttir:</br>
                Following their earlier collaboration Vitundin er spírall from Júlía’s upcoming album, where Þóranna composed for the halldórófón, Júlía and Þóranna now come together again to explore for the first time the dialogue between the halldórófón and Stacco, a new magnetic and AI-driven instrument created by Nicola Privato.</br></br>

                In collaboration with Jan Hendrickse:</br>
                Their first collaboration, a piece Jan composed for the halldórófón on Júlía’s forthcoming album for halldórófón and acoustic spaces, marked the beginning of their work together. Now performing together, Júlía and Jan continue this exploration through the halldórófón and Jan’s feedback and acoustic flutes.</br></br>
                Júlía Mogensen:</br>
                Júlía is a classically trained cellist, a keen interpreter of new and experimental music with an interest in the complex relationship between performer, instrument, and composition. She has collaborated and improvised with a broad range of artists—on stage, in recordings, across film, video, and sound art—both as a performer and composer. She was a member of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra from 2013 to 2019, and continues to appear regularly as a guest performer.</br>
                In recent years Júlía has been in creative collaboration with Halldór Úlfarsson, inventor of the halldorophone—a pioneering electroacoustic feedback instrument where she has been exploring the instrument’s unique possibilities through performances and commissioned works. She has just completed recording her first solo album, a four-piece project, in which four composers create original works for halldorophone and a chosen acoustic space, set to be released early 2026.</br></br>

                Earnest, intimate, heartfelt, delicate: Andervel is the music project of singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist José Luis Anderson. Born and raised in Mexico, Anderson creates a unique brand of folk music, seen through the lens of multicultural identity. Andervel's work is defined by a timeless, classically-trained voice and carefully crafted lyrics moving seamlessly between Spanish, Icelandic, and English.</br></br>

                On his latest single ‘Ég finn’, Mexican-born, Reykjavík-based artist Andervel continues his poetic exploration of identity, belonging, and cultural adaptation. A tender and expansive folk song, ‘Ég finn’ captures the space between two homelands - where the warmth of Mexico meets the cool, introspective landscapes of Iceland.</br></br>

                Andervel performs as a band, joined by Sigurlaug Thorarensen, Sólrún Mjöll Kjartansdóttir and Sakaris Emil Joensen. </br></br>

                i've been working on some new songs over the last year and a half and realised i was mostly working with lots of voices, layered and in harmonies, and the good old guitar. so this fall i reached out to some friends who i knew had beautiful voices but also were interested in playing more guitar and we started meeting up regularly and learn and workshop these new songs together. we had a great time playing them at iceland airwaves a couple of weeks ago and now we're going to bring it to mengi. the players are: áslaug magnúsdóttir, anna róshildur and fríða björg pétursdóttir. </br></br>


                JFDR is Jófríður Ákadóttir. As a 14 year old in Reykjavik Ákadóttir began her musical career exploring the vast universe of experimental music while retaining a massive heart at her core. Over the past 12 years Ákadóttir has released 12 records including as a member of Pascal Pinon & Samaris collaborated with renowned artists Ólafur Arnalds and Damien Rice, scored the award-winning Icelandic film Backyard Village and garnered fans across the world – including Björk who cites Ákadóttir as an inspiration. Following 2017’s Brazil (her first record as JFDR), Ákadóttir returned with 2020’s New Dreams “very haunting electro-pop music that’s very subtle very inward looking” (NPR Music) and “the kind of album that might give you space to reach your own small revelations” (Stereogum). Her new album Museum is out now. In March 2024 it won Icelandic album of the year at the Iceland Music Awards. </br></br>

            <h3>SAT 13.12 SPACESTATION Jólacoustic tónleikar + Iðunn Einars</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://blink.blikk.tech/4371d647-1a13-4f30-99e2-d9707f423266">Tickets</a></br></br>
                
                Saturday, December 13th</br>
                SPACESTATION JÓLATÓNLEIKAR / IÐUNN EINARS</br>
                doors 19:30 / show 20:00</br>
                2.990kr</br></br>

               Strákarnir í hljómsveitinni Spacestation hafa farið svaðilför um Íslenska tónlistarsenu seinustu misseri og hafa fest sig í sessi sem eitt öflugasta rokkband hér á landi um þessar mundir. </br></br>

                Sveitin gaf út plötuna “Reykjavík Syndrome” fyrr á árinu sem hlaut lof gagnrýnenda og miklar vinsældir. Spacestation hefur einnig verið að gera mjög góða hluti erlendis en seinastliðna mánuði hafa þeir verið á tónleikaferðalagi um Evrópu og spilað í 14 borgum og fengið mjög góðar móttökur.</br></br>

                Að loknum túrnum tekur við löngu verðskuldað jólafrí og friður og ró og ætla strákarnir að halda uppá það með þægilegum og kosy jólatónleikum í Mengi þann 13. desember næstkomandi. Seinustu tónleikarnir sem bandið spilar þetta árið!</br></br>

                Spacestation spilar indí rokkað post-punk með shoegaze’uðu 60’s rokk ívafi. En lætin fá að víkja í þetta sinn og verður kvöldið með öllu rólegra móti þar sem þetta verða svokallaðir “acoustic” tónleikar, þeir fyrstu sinnar tegundar sem bandið flytur. Ekkert pedala stapp eða feedback suð heldur bara ljúfir strengjaslættir og kertaljós, tími til kominn eftir allann hamagang ársins. Hver veit nema nokkur jólalög komi við sögu? Og jafnvel jólagestur??</br></br>
