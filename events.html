                Wednesday, December 17th</br>
                ONE DANCE AFTER ANOTHER</br>
                Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, Ella Eidstad Pedersen, María Kristín Jóhannsdóttir</br>
                doors 19:30 / show 20:00</br></br>
                2500kr</br></br>

                Vikivaki, Macarena, línudans, salsa, WAP, Fortnite, Y.M.C.A og allt þar á milli. </br></br>

                Óður til dansanna sem hafa sameinað venjulegt fólk um allan heim í gegnum tíðina, hvort heldur sem er á dansgólfinu, Tiktok eða Popptíví. Hér sameinast dansarnir sem hafa sameinað okkur. </br></br>

                Ásrún Magnúsdóttir er hugmyndasmiður verksins. Hún er danshöfundur sem hefur komið víða við. Í verkum sínum fær hún ólíklegasta fólk til að koma fram og teygir þannig út hefðbundnar hugmyndir um dans og kóreógrafíu.</br></br>

                Ella Eidstad Pedersen er flytjandi verksins. Hún lauk dansnámi frá Listaháskólanum Í Osló en hefur prófað sitt lítið af hverju: tai chi, hip-hop, söngleikjadans, argentískan tangó, salsa, vouging, locking, halling, amapiano, kung-fu, dabke, hæla, street, rúmba, dancehall og mjög mikið tiktok inn í herbergi í covid. </br></br>

                María Kristín Jóhannsdóttir er dj verksins. Hún er dansari og danshöfundur útskrifuð frá Listaháskóla Íslands. Í dansi hefur hún mestan áhuga á að kanna mörk sviðsetningar og veruleika. Þegar hún er ekki að dansa er hún venjulega að dj-a eða að plotta framtíðina.  </br></br>

                ONE DANCE AFTER ANOTHER</br></br>

                Vikivaki, Macarena, line dancing, salsa, WAP, Fortnite, Y.M.C.A and everything in between. </br></br>

                An ode to the dances that have united ordinary people around the world throughout history, whether on the dance floor, Tiktok or Popptíví. </br></br>

                Ásrún Magnúsdóttir is the creator of the work. Her work aims to stretch the dominant modes of dance and choreography and has been received well at home and abroad. She is interested in amplifying voices that she feels might be heard better; giving the stage to other people to speak up, be seen and listened to.  </br></br>

                Ella Eidstad Pedersen is the dancer of the work. She studied contemporary dance at Oslo National Academy of the Arts but has done a little bit of everything: tai chi, hip hop, musical dance, Argentinian tango, salsa, voguing, locking, halling, amapiano, kung fu, dabke, heels, commercial street, rumba, dance hall and a lot of tiktok dances in her bedroom during covid. </br></br>

                María Kristín Jóhannsdóttir is the dj of the work. She is a dancer and a choreographer graduated from Iceland University of the Arts. Her interest when it comes to dance and performance involves experimenting with the boundaries of performance and reality. When she’s not dancing she is usually DJing or plotting future moves. </br></br>

            <p>

                Sunday, December 21st</br>
                WEAVING</br>
                Interactive installation: 17:00 – 20:00 (pay what you can)</br>
                Performance: 20:00 – 21:00 (2500kr / 2000kr students)</br></br>

                The installation WEAVING is designed around the living sound sculpture Core Being. Instead of presenting a specific final form, the sculpture creates conditions for exploring a world that is always in the making. The sculpture is in continuous development as it takes on different roles and morphs into various shapes, of which this installation is one. Like the sculpture, the installation is inspired by subterranean textures and collaborative structures in nature, specifically mycorrhizal fungi that exist in symbiosis with plants. The sculpture is made from wood and hand-dyed threads. The threads are stretched between the wooden panels and extend from the sculpture into its surroundings.</br></br>

                Finding inspiration in Ragnheiður Erla Björnsdóttir’s text Morphology of the Fungi, sound artist Lilja María Ásmundsdóttir weaves a soundscape based on real-world geophone recordings meeting the imagined subterranean habitat of the sculpture. On December 21st between 17:00 and 20:00, the audience is invited to interact with the installation and activate its sound world through touch, or explore the space and listen to the soundscape. Visitors are welcome to come and go as they please, stay for a short while or a longer time. At 20:00, dancer Inês Zinho Pinheiro and Lilja María will perform inside the installation.</br></br>

                Iðunn Einars er tónskáld, fiðluleikari og söngkona sem skapar sína tónlist einhver staðar á milli klassíkur og popps. Fyrsta plata hennar í fullri lengd, Í hennar heimi, kom út í nóvember 2024 og vakti töluverða athygli. Í desember sama ár hlaut platan Kraumsverðlaunin og var hún einnig tilnefnd til plötu ársins í poppi á Íslensku tónlistarverðlaunum 2025. Á tónleikunum mun Iðunn spila lögin af Í hennar heimi ásamt bandi og strengjatríói. Þetta verða hennar síðustu tónleikar í bili þar sem hún kveður tónlist plötunnar áður en hún snýr sér að nýjum tónlistarverkefnum. </br></br>

                Iðunn Einars is a composer, violinist and a singer. She creates her music somewhere between the genres of classical music and pop. Her first full length album, Í hennar heimi, was released in November 2024 and attracted considerable attention in her home town of Reykjavík. The album won the Kraumur Award 2024 and was nominated for the pop-album of the year at the Icelandic Music Awards 2025. In this concert Iðunn will perform the songs from Í hennar heimi with a band and a string trio. This will be her last concert for some time, serving as a closing chapter for the album as she moves on to new work. </br></br>

                Taking a new spin on her released and unreleased music, lúpína will create a unique experience where she will transport you into a world of vocal layers and live looping. This is a one time experience, where she will create sounds by only using loops of her voice, synths and piano. Join lúpína for this intimate re-creation of her music in an unplugged setting. </br></br>

                Lúpína is an Icelandic/Norwegian singer, producer and songwriter.  She began her journey by releasing her dreamy Icelandic synth pop single alein in autumn 2022. Since then, she has captivated audiences with her debut album ringluð in 2023 followed by MARGLYTTA in 2024. MARGLYTTA is an ode to herself, allowing people to see through her and her emotions - just like a jellyfish.</br></br>

                Lúpína's unique style and impressive performances earned her the 2024 Iceland Airwaves Plus award, where she got the opportunity to perform at the New Colossus festival in 2025. This was followed by showcases at SXSW in Austin and Roskilde. Today, lúpína is a rising artist in the Icelandic and international music scene. </br></br>

            <h3>WED 28.01 HOYM / Bjarni Daníel</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://hlekkir.blikk.tech/5c064c87-5b31-49ee-9640-e662af89c1a2">Tickets</a></br></br>
                
                Wednesday, January 28th</br>
                HOYM / Bjarni Daníel</br>
                doors 19:30 / show 20:00</br>
                2500kr / 2000kr students / pay what u can</br></br>

                HOYM will play songs from their debut EP, Lög frá Farbraut — a captivating six-track EP written and performed in Faroese and Icelandic. The EP is the result of a unique collaboration between Elinborg Pálsdóttir (FO), Lea Kampmann (FO), and Katrín Helga Ólafsdóttir/k.óla (IS), three voices in the Nordic music scene brought together by a shared artistic vision and deep-rooted friendship. The EP was recorded in the south of Iceland in January 2025, where the trio immersed themselves in the creative process. With a sound that blends introspective folk and acoustic vibes, Lög frá Farbraut explores themes of belonging, and emotional connection — bridging cultures, languages and landscapes. The songs were recorded live in a studio with a fireplace in the background, and the trio was gathered around one microphone, each with an acoustic guitar. All the songs were captured in just a few takes, preserving the raw emotion and intimacy of the moment. HOYM was born from the artists’ time together at the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in. Each member of HOYM has an established solo career, and numerous releases under their own names. Now, they unite their voices to form something new: a project grounded in femininity, presence and collaborative spirit. "We wanted to create something that celebrates both our shared roots and our individual voices. Writing together in our mother tongues — Faroese and Icelandic — felt like a powerful way to honour where we come from, while also pushing ourselves into new territory," the trio shares.</br></br>
